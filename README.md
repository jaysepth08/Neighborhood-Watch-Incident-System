# Neighborhood-Watch-Incident-System
## Project Description
The **Neighborhood Watch Incident System** is a digital platform designed to strengthen community safety and improve incident reporting. It enables residents to report crimes, fire incidents, natural disasters, and other emergencies in real time. Reports can include **photos, videos, and location details**, which are then sent to administrators and law enforcement for validation and response.

The system improves communication between residents, barangay officials, and law enforcement agencies through:
- **Automated Alerts** (SMS, Email, Push Notifications)
- **Geospatial Mapping** of incidents
- **Centralized Dashboards** for monitoring and trend analysis

By digitizing incident reporting, the platform promotes **faster response times, enhanced collaboration, and stronger community engagement**, making neighborhoods safer and more resilient.

## Key Features
- **Incident Logging** – Residents can submit incident reports with details, photos, or videos.
- **Real-time Notifications** – Instant alerts for urgent or verified incidents.
- **Geospatial Mapping** – Visual display of reported incidents and hotspots.
- **Role-based Access** – Separate access levels for residents, administrators, and law enforcement.
- **Dashboard & Reporting** – Centralized monitoring for better decision-making.
- **Secure Data Handling** – Ensures privacy and data encryption.


## Target Users
- **Residents** – Main reporters of incidents within their community.
- **Administrators** – Manage platform operations, verify incident reports, and oversee the system.
- **Law Enforcement / Responders** – Receive verified reports, respond to emergencies, and analyze crime trends.
